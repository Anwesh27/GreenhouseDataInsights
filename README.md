  - **Agriculture (17.07%)**: Methane emissions from livestock and rice paddies are key contributors.

- **United States**  
  Accounting for **17.53%** of global emissions (**342.35 Gt CO2eq/yr**), the U.S. faces challenges from high per capita energy consumption. Key sources include:  
  - **Power Industry (30.20%)**: Fossil fuels dominate energy production.  
  - **Transport (28.34%)**: Vehicle emissions form a significant portion.  
  - **Fuel Exploitation (31.41%)**: Oil and gas extraction processes significantly contribute.  

- **Russia**  
  Emitting **6.45%** of global greenhouse gases (**125.90 Gt CO2eq/yr**), Russia’s emissions are heavily influenced by:  
  - **Power Industry (37.47%)**: Primarily from gas and coal.  
  - **Fuel Exploitation (25.66%)**: Extensive oil and gas industries drive emissions.  
  - **Buildings (23.79%)**: Energy-intensive heating systems play a role.
