## 🌟 **Key Outcomes & Achievements (Quantitative Insights)**  

### **Global Emissions Growth**  
- **1970**: Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were **14 gigatonnes (Gt)**.  
- **2023**: Emissions rose to over **55 Gt CO2 equivalent (CO2e)**.  
- **Key Period**: Highest emissions growth occurred between **2000 and 2010**, driven by rapid industrialization.  

### **Top Contributors**  
- **China**: Emits the highest percentage of global emissions, approximately **28%**.  
- **USA**: Contributes **15%**, with high per capita emissions of **14.6 tonnes annually**.  
- **India**: Accounts for **7%**, showcasing the increasing role of developing nations.  

### **Sectoral Dynamics**  
- **Energy Sector**: Responsible for **73%** of global emissions, predominantly from fossil fuels.  
- **Agriculture**: Contributes **19%**, driven by methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O).  
- **Industrial Processes**: Account for **8%,** primarily from cement and chemical production.
